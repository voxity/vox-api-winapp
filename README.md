# Voxity API Windows client

This applications consists of a sample implementation of a Voxity API client in the form of a Windows application.

### Important notice!
This application requires, like any other Voxity API client, the use of a client-specific identifier and secret. These values can be obtained on the [Octopus](https://client.voxity.fr) interface.

These values have to be defined in the [application's settings template](VoxiLink/Properties/Settings.settings), in the ***CLIENT_ID*** and ***CLIENT_SECRET*** keys.
